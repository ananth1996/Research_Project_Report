% Elections are central in most democratic societies. 


% This is also the case with Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia hosted on the Internet. Wikipedia started out as an open society where anyone could create new Wikipedia articles and edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. This initial system soon changed once the popularity of the encyclopedia started to grow. Many versions of Wikipedia, most notably the English Wikipedia started to only allow registered users to make edits on Wikipedia articles. The initial lawlessness of Wikipedia soon evolved to incorporate democratic principles and hierarchy. 

% Administrators or more commonly referred to as \textit{admins} are a group of Wikipedia editors who have been granted certain privileges and tools such as deletion of articles, prevent editing of certain pages, protect articles from vandalism etc. \cite{ViscousDemocracy}
