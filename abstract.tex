Wikipedia is a well known online encyclopedia containing over 5 million pages of content. In contrast the number of active Wikipedia members who maintain all this information is relatively small. 
For a Wikipedia member to rise to the level of an administrator, they or a nominator need to submit a request for Adminship (RfA). In this election any Wikipedia may cast a vote in support, opposition or neutral towards the candidate.
This provides us with a very rich dataset on voting patterns withing Wikipedia members. The goal of this project is to collect data of such votes as well as data regarding individual Wikipedia member's contributions.
This allows us to create and analyze voting and interaction networks among all Wikipedia users.
